# MyPython
Pratical Project for PL (Processamento de Linguagens) Curricular Unit

The goal is to develop language processors according to the syntax-driven translation method, based on a translating grammar, and to develop a compiler generating code for a virtual stack machine. For the development of this practical work, we will use the virtual stack machine VM, Virtual Machine, and the PLY library in Python, more specifically YACC and LEX.
